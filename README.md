# Spring Core Concepts Material
Java Spring Core is the foundational module of the Spring Framework, which is one of the most popular and widely used frameworks for building enterprise-level Java applications. Spring Core provides the essential features and capabilities that underpin the entire Spring ecosystem, enabling developers to create robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. Below is an in-depth explanation of the key concepts and components of Java Spring Core.
## 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a fundamental principle in Spring Core. It refers to the reversal of the flow of control in a system, where the framework takes over the responsibility of managing the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, rather than the objects themselves managing their dependencies.
Key Points:

    Decoupling: IoC decouples the execution of a task from its implementation, allowing for more modular and flexible code.
    Control Shift: Instead of the application code controlling the flow, the Spring container manages object creation, configuration, and lifecycle.

## 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that implements IoC. It involves supplying an object's dependencies from an external source rather than the object creating them itself. This leads to more testable and maintainable code.
Types of Dependency Injection:

    Constructor Injection:
        Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
        Ensures that the object is always in a valid state with all required dependencies.

        java

        public class UserService {
            private final UserRepository userRepository;

            public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
                this.userRepository = userRepository;
            }
        }

Setter Injection:

    Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
    Allows for optional dependencies and reconfigurability.

java

public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public void setUserRepository(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }
}

Field Injection:

    Dependencies are injected directly into fields using annotations.
    Less recommended due to challenges in testing and potential for hidden dependencies.

java

    public class UserService {
        @Autowired
        private UserRepository userRepository;
    }

## 3. Beans and the Spring Container
Beans:

    Definition: In Spring, a bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container.
    Configuration: Beans are defined in configuration metadata, which can be XML-based, annotation-based, or Java-based.

Spring Container:

    Function: The Spring container is responsible for creating and managing the lifecycle of beans, handling dependency injection, and managing configurations.
    Common Implementations:
        ApplicationContext: A more feature-rich container suitable for most applications.
        BeanFactory: A lightweight container providing basic DI features, primarily used for testing or in simple scenarios.

Bean Lifecycle:

    Instantiation: The container creates an instance of the bean.
    Populate Properties: Dependencies are injected.
    BeanNameAware and other Aware Interfaces: The bean is aware of its container.
    Pre-initialization: BeanPostProcessors can modify the bean before initialization.
    InitializingBean and init-method: Custom initialization logic is executed.
    Post-initialization: BeanPostProcessors can modify the bean after initialization.
    Ready to use: The bean is fully initialized and ready for use.
    Destruction: The container handles bean destruction, calling any destruction callbacks.

## 4. Configuration Metadata

Configuration metadata tells the Spring container how to create and configure beans. There are three primary ways to provide this metadata:

### 1. XML Configuration:

Traditional method using XML files to define beans and their dependencies.

    ```    xml

    <beans>
        <bean id="userRepository" class="com.example.UserRepository" />
        <bean id="userService" class="com.example.UserService">
            <property name="userRepository" ref="userRepository" />
        </bean>
    </beans>```

### 2. Annotation-Based Configuration:

Uses annotations to declare beans and their dependencies directly in the code. 

    ```    java

    @Component
    public class UserRepository { }

    @Service
    public class UserService {
        @Autowired
        private UserRepository userRepository;
    } ```

**Common Annotations:**
**@Component:** Generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
**@Service:** Specialization of @Component for service-layer classes.
**@Repository:** Specialization of @Component for data access objects.
**@Controller:** Specialization of @Component for MVC controllers.

3. Java-Based Configuration:

    Uses Java classes annotated with @Configuration to define beans using @Bean methods.

java

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public UserRepository userRepository() {
        return new UserRepository();
    }

    @Bean
    public UserService userService() {
        return new UserService(userRepository());
    }
}

## 5. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

While not exclusively part of Spring Core, AOP is a key feature facilitated by Spring that allows for the separation of cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, and transaction management) from the business logic.
Key Concepts:

    Aspect: A modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes.
    Join Point: A point in the execution of the program, such as method execution.
    Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point (e.g., before, after, around).
    Pointcut: A predicate that matches join points.

## 6. Spring Expression Language (SpEL)

SpEL is a powerful expression language that supports querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. It is integrated into Spring Core and can be used in configuration metadata to dynamically set bean properties.
Example:

xml

<bean id="exampleBean" class="com.example.Example">
    <property name="value" value="#{2 * T(Math).PI}" />
</bean>

## 7. Profiles and Environment Abstraction

Spring Core allows defining profiles to segregate parts of the application configuration and make it only available in certain environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
Example:

java

@Configuration
@Profile("development")
public class DevConfig {
    // Development-specific beans
}

@Configuration
@Profile("production")
public class ProdConfig {
    // Production-specific beans
}

You can activate a profile using configuration files, environment variables, or JVM arguments.
## 8. Resource Management

Spring Core provides a consistent way to manage different types of resources (files, URLs, classpath resources) through its Resource interface, abstracting the underlying resource handling.
Example:

java

@Autowired
private ResourceLoader resourceLoader;

public void loadResource() {
    Resource resource = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:data.txt");
    // Handle the resource
}

## 9. Event Handling

Spring Core includes an event-publishing mechanism that allows beans to publish and listen for events, enabling a decoupled communication model within the application.
Key Components:

    ApplicationEvent: Base class for events.
    ApplicationListener: Interface for listening to events.
    ApplicationEventPublisher: Interface for publishing events.

Example:

java

public class CustomEvent extends ApplicationEvent {
    public CustomEvent(Object source) {
        super(source);
    }
}

@Component
public class CustomEventListener implements ApplicationListener<CustomEvent> {
    @Override
    public void onApplicationEvent(CustomEvent event) {
        // Handle the event
    }
}

@Component
public class EventPublisherBean {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

    public void publish() {
        publisher.publishEvent(new CustomEvent(this));
    }
}

## 10. Bean Scopes

Spring Core supports various bean scopes, determining the lifecycle and visibility of beans within the application context.
Common Scopes:

    Singleton: (Default) A single shared instance per Spring IoC container.
    Prototype: A new instance each time the bean is requested.
    Request: A single instance per HTTP request (web-aware applications).
    Session: A single instance per HTTP session (web-aware applications).
    Global Session: A single instance per global HTTP session (for Portlet-based web applications).

Example:

java

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean { }

## 11. Lazy Initialization

By default, Spring creates and configures all singleton beans at startup. However, you can enable lazy initialization to create beans only when they are needed, which can improve application startup time and resource usage.
Example:

java

@Component
@Lazy
public class LazyBean { }

Alternatively, configure it globally in the application context.
## 12. Integration with Other Spring Modules

Spring Core serves as the backbone for other Spring modules, such as:

    Spring AOP: For aspect-oriented programming.
    Spring Data: For data access and ORM support.
    Spring MVC: For building web applications.
    Spring Security: For authentication and authorization.
    Spring Boot: For simplifying Spring application setup.

## Conclusion

Java Spring Core provides a robust and flexible foundation for building Java applications by leveraging key principles like Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. Its comprehensive configuration options, lifecycle management, and integration capabilities make it an essential tool for developers aiming to create maintainable and scalable enterprise applications. Understanding Spring Core's core concepts is crucial for effectively utilizing the broader Spring Framework and its ecosystem.
